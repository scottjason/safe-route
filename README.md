###Safe Route

Live Link: http://scottjason.github.io/saferoute

A single-page web application that provides three routes to any destination: the safest, the shortest and the most dangerous. (at this time it works only in San Francisco. If you're outside the city just replace the start and end fields with SF addresses).
